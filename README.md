# GitHubRobot

* Implemented a RPA project using UiPath Studio: a robot that extracts informations about a chosen programming language from a given list via GitHub. 
* Note: - if you are logged in on github, the robot may not work properly due to problems recognizing the exact same page as in the scraping of data;
        - the data scraping doesn't work all the time, unfortunately
